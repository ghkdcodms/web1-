<h2>KILL YOUR DARLINGS</h2>
Be careful <strong>You are not in <u><a href="https://namu.wiki/w/%ED%98%84%EC%8B%A4" target="_blank">wonderland</a></u></strong> I have heard the strange medness long growing in your soul
but you are fortunate in your ignorance, in your isolation
<br><br>you who have suffered.
<br>find where love hides
<br><br><strong>give</strong> <br><strong>share</strong><br><strong>lose</strong>
<br><br>lest we die unbloomed<br><br>
<br><br><p>
The movie Kill Your Darling is my favorite movie.<br>
There is a poem in this movie that impressed me deeply. I realized in the poem. <br>I thought that I was strange, thinking that I was strange in this world.
<br>And I felt it while watching this movie.That it can be a blessing.
<br>There will be many people in this world who think that something is wrong. <br>Although it will serve as a disadvantage in this society, <br>it will present broader and deeper imaginations and ideals.</p>
